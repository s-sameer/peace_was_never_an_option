# peace_was_never_an_option
2D Endless Runner game created using Unity

Description:

Peace Was Never An Option is a 2D endless runner game build, using Unity and C#,  based off of JetPack Joyride. 
In this game the player controls a goose which can fly to avoid obstacles and obtain power ups, as well as coins. 
These coins are saved within the game and can be used within the Shop menu to purchase customized geese; such as a 
goose with a knife, a shooter, as well as a lumberjack. The powerups all make the character invincible for 5 seconds, 
as well as having stronger wing power, and faster speed. If the character happens to collide with an obstacle without a powerup, 
they will lose the game. To control the player, use the spacebar or up arrow key. To pause the game press the escape button.
